# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [0.3.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- `SignalIndex` (`packages/core/src/signal_index.ts`) — in-memory typed verdict index; reads `Signals/` dir, filters expired records, loads per-request with `MAX_RECORDS=500` and `MAX_RECORD_BYTES=10240`.
- `GET /vault/signal` endpoint — returns active (non-expired) `SignalRecord[]`; empty array is a valid cold-start response.
- `GET /vault/reversed?id=` endpoint — scans `P10-Plans/` for plans citing a verdict ID; path traversal guarded; `MAX_PLAN_FILES=500`.
- `score_confidence` MCP tool (tool #6) — deterministic tiered veto: HIGH (≥2 distinct in-date records, known pattern, topic Jaccard ≥ 0.5) proceeds; LOW halts with disqualifiers.
- `scoreConfidence` function (`packages/core/src/scoreConfidence.ts`) — binary cardinality + Jaccard veto with novel-pattern halt; per ADR-0007; `N_DISTINCT=2`, `JACCARD_MATCH_THRESHOLD=0.5`.
- `auditContradictions` — pure function that flags plans with `loop_informed:true` citing expired or missing verdicts.
- `checkProvenance` — fail-closed provenance binding; cited-but-not-returned records are a hard reject.
- `toto backfill` CLI command — ingests `ADR/` and `P10-Plans/` into `Signals/` with `pattern` and `topic_tags` fields; idempotent via lowercase ID dedup.
- `SIGNAL_PATTERNS` closed enum: `shared-session-state-auth-extraction`, `architectural-decision-record`, `p10-approved-plan`.
- Strangler-pattern skill tiered veto — calls `score_confidence` MCP tool deterministically; halts on LOW with disqualifiers surfaced.
- `ADR-0001` (`docs/ADR/ADR-0001-system-architecture.md`) — records monorepo package structure, vault flat-file decision, and loopback-only binding rationale.
- 13 new tests (8 × `scoreConfidence`, 5 × `checkProvenance`); 64 total passing.

### Fixed
- `scoreConfidence.ts:69` — replaced `now.length === 10` check with an ISO regex; US-format dates now throw instead of silently passing (ISSUE-002).
- `runBackfill` — `existingIds` set normalized to lowercase to prevent duplicate signal writes on macOS HFS+ case-insensitive volumes (ISSUE-001).

### Security
- `dashboard_html.ts` — `item.date` and `b.date` values in inline script block wrapped in `escHtml()` to close XSS vector in date output (SEC-001).
- `.gitleaks.toml` — added `manifest-auth-token` rule matching `mnfst_` prefix with placeholder allowlist entry (SEC-002).

## [0.2.0] - 2026-06-22 (same-day follow-on to 0.1.0)

### Added
- `GET /dashboard/events` SSE endpoint — broadcasts `connected`, `stats` (councilCount, p10Count, blockedCount every 15s), and `error` events; keep-alive comment every 10s; 503 when at capacity (max 50 clients).
- `GET /dashboard/record` endpoint — serves raw council and P10 vault records; path traversal guard via `path.sep` suffix check; 100 KB cap (HTTP 413); ENOENT → 404, unexpected errors → 500 with no stack trace in response body.
- `packages/mcp-server/src/handlers/sse_registry.ts` — singleton SSE broadcast registry; shared intervals start on 0→1 client and clear on N→0; `res.destroyed` guard on every write; exports `isAtCapacity()`.
- `packages/mcp-server/src/handlers/sse_handler.ts` — `handleSseRequest`; capacity check fires before `writeHead(200)` to prevent `ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT` on the 503 path.
- `packages/mcp-server/src/handlers/record_handler.ts` — `handleRecordRequest`; sibling-prefix traversal protection via `path.sep`.
- `packages/mcp-server/src/handlers/dashboard_status.ts` — `handleDashboardStatus` extracted from `index.ts`; introduces `DashboardStats` interface and `isValidItemType` guard.
- Dashboard UI: live `#connection-status` (aria-live), `#panel-spinner`, slide-in record panel, mobile overlay at 768px breakpoint and full-screen below 768px, `#blocked-count` aria-live.
- 23 new tests: 9 SSE unit, 14 record unit, 1 real-socket integration test verifying clean interval teardown on hard disconnect.

### Changed
- `packages/mcp-server/src/index.ts` — net -88 lines; `handleRequest` now takes `req: IncomingMessage`; SSE and record routes registered before TOOLS lookup.
- `packages/cli/src/commands/dashboard.ts` — added `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` credential hint to the server-unreachable error message.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- `packages/cli` with 8 commands: `init`, `doctor`, `whoami`, `search`, `last`, `audit`, `dashboard`, `radio`.
- `toto radio` command — interactive pit wall chat; Anthropic streaming or Ollama NDJSON; controlled via `TOTO_RADIO_PROVIDER`, `TOTO_RADIO_MODEL`, and `OLLAMA_HOST` env vars.
- `toto doctor` — INFO-level Ollama probe that lists available models (non-blocking).
- `toto` landing UI — pit lane status showing blocked P10 count, governance-voiced command descriptions, and a daily team-radio quote.
- `packages/mcp-server` — 5 MCP tools (`vault_write`, `vault_search`, `council_run`, `p10_plan`, `dashboard_status`) plus `GET /dashboard` server-rendered HTML paddock interface.
- Dashboard: Mercedes design tokens, JetBrains Mono, slide panel, mobile-responsive layout, WCAG 44px touch targets.
- `packages/personas` — engineering, devops, r-and-d, and data persona stubs.

## [0.0.5.1] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed
- `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — migrated esbuild build approval to pnpm 11 `allowBuilds` field; pnpm 10's `onlyBuiltDependencies` was silently dropped in pnpm 11.5.1, breaking the local build gate with `ERR_PNPM_IGNORED_BUILDS`.

### Changed
- Pinned pnpm 11.5.1 via `packageManager` field and Node 24 via `.nvmrc` as single sources of truth; CI jobs now read `packageManager` and `node-version-file` instead of hardcoded pnpm 9 / Node 20.

### Documentation
- `CLAUDE.md` — corrected `/p10` skill path reference from `p10/P10.md` to `p10/SKILL.md`.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-06-15

### Added
- `CouncilService` — persona injection for all 5 roles (scout1, scout2, analyst1, analyst2, chairman).
- `CouncilService` — 2-turn compression between scouts and analysts (Format Tax paper).
- `CouncilService` — context positioning places important context at primacy position (Lost in the Middle paper).
- `P10Service` — same context positioning, 2-turn compression, and temperature=0 pattern as `CouncilService`.
- `dashboard_status` MCP tool.
- `packages/dashboard` — terminal governance dashboard package.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — CI pipeline unblocking Phase 1 eval-gate.

### Fixed
- `eslint` config — `parserOptions.project` now targets per-package tsconfigs; root solution-style config had resolved zero source files, silently failing lint.
- `packages/dashboard` — aligned `tsconfig.json` with core/mcp-server (`composite`, `exclude`), added to root project references, removed vestigial `scanDirectory` parameter, made `render` function non-async.
- `P10Service` — added explicit return types on the six prompt-builder functions.

### Changed
- `packages/core/src/P10Service.ts` — scout/analyzer/arbiter prompts replaced with structured role-specific templates: Skeptic scout, Minimalist scout, ranked-risk Analyzer, structured DraftWriter, 8-rule Arbiter.

### Documentation
- `CLAUDE.md` MCP server section — replaced hardcoded absolute start-command path with a `<repo>` placeholder so the setup reference works on any clone.

### Security
- `CLAUDE.md` — documented per-user MCP credentials (`ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` via each developer's `~/.claude.json`; placeholder-only example in tracked files).
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — added gitleaks secret-scan job wiring the existing `.gitleaks.toml` into the pipeline.

## [0.0.4.1] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- `tests/bootstrap-env.bats` — 9 tests covering all-pass path, report-all contract, per-tool isolation, multi-source accumulation, Option B partial/complete credential paths, and git init gating behind a clean preflight.

### Changed
- `scripts/bootstrap-env.sh` — preflight now reports all failed prerequisites in one pass before exiting once, instead of stopping on the first failure; exit codes unchanged (0 pass / 2 fail).
- `scripts/bootstrap-env.sh` — `fail()` now returns `0` explicitly to prevent a future trailing non-zero statement from collapsing report-all back to fail-fast.

## [0.0.4.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- `scripts/demo.sh` — drives the full governance cycle end-to-end: preflight check, `council_run` with a real architectural question, `p10_plan` with a real task.
- `packages/core/src/utils/anthropic.ts` — universal Anthropic client factory; accepts `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` alone or `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` + `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` together; fails fast with a clear error if neither is set.
- `packages/core/src/utils/anthropic.test.ts` — 5 tests covering both auth paths, both-set precedence, and missing-credentials fast-fail.
- `packages/core/src/VaultService.test.ts` — real (no-mock) integration test verifying `drainQueue()` resolves and the file persists in a temp directory with no `.git`.
- `packages/mcp-server/src/handlers/p10_plan.test.ts` — two tests: `P10BlockedError` returns `{status:'blocked'}` (HTTP 200), and non-blocked errors rethrow cleanly.

### Fixed
- `P10Service` — hard-asserted `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` at construction time; migrated to `createAnthropicClient()` to support Manifest/enterprise-token setups.
- `VaultService.commitFile` — crashes on a fresh clone with no `.git`; now detects via `git rev-parse --git-dir` exit-128 and returns `{committed: false, reason: 'not a git repo'}` without blocking the file write.
- `p10_plan` handler — `P10BlockedError` was bubbling as HTTP 500; now returns HTTP 200 `{status:'blocked'}` and writes a fixed string to stderr with no vault path leak.

### Changed
- `README.md` — added plain-language intro, two-altitude auth section (Option A / Option B with precedence note), and MCP server v2 roadmap note.

## [0.0.3.0] - 2026-06-08

### Added
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — CI pipeline: typecheck and test on every PR and push; `eval-gate` job gates main pushes on `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` secret and all 3 assertions passing.
- `scripts/install-symlink.sh` — wires toto-wolff governance into any repo via symlink; backs up existing `CLAUDE.md`; validates target is a git repo (worktree-aware) and role slug is allowlisted.
- Phase 1 MCP foundation: `VaultService`, `CouncilService`, `P10Service`, `withLLMTimeout` in `packages/core`; `vault_write`, `vault_search`, `council_run`, `p10_plan` handlers and HTTP server in `packages/mcp-server`; `scripts/eval-gate.ts` 3/3 exit gate.

### Fixed
- `P10Service` — revision cap exhaustion now forces `status: blocked` instead of falling through to an `AssertionError` in `commitPlan`.
- `CouncilService` — added `drainQueue()` after `vault.write` in `runSession`; council records were written to disk but never committed to vault git history.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — eval-gate job sets `user.email` and `user.name` on the ephemeral vault before running; git commit in VaultService fails on runners with no global git identity.
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — eval-gate now uses `pnpm exec tsx` (locked version) instead of `npx tsx`.
- `scripts/install-symlink.sh` — git repo check uses `git rev-parse --git-dir` (worktree-safe) instead of `-d .git`; path traversal guard added for `TOTO_ROLE` env var.

### Changed
- `personas/engineering.md` — rewritten with welcoming tone, explains council/p10/role-switch commands, and adds a first-run onboarding line.
- `packages/core/src/P10Service.ts` — scout/analyzer/arbiter prompts replaced with structured role-specific templates: Skeptic scout, Minimalist scout, ranked-risk Analyzer, structured DraftWriter, 8-rule Arbiter.

### Security
- `scripts/install-symlink.sh:30` — `TOTO_ROLE` validated against `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]+$` before constructing the persona file path; blocks path traversal via `TOTO_ROLE=../../../tmp/payload`.

## [0.0.2.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- `setup --role <name>` — swaps the `# ROLE` section in `CLAUDE.md` to a named persona (`engineering`, `devops`, `r-and-d`, `data`); aborts on dirty `CLAUDE.md`, missing persona, or stub personas; backup rotation keeps last 5.
- `.toto/config.yml.example` — team config template with `vault_path`, `vault_remote`, and `linear_workspace` fields.
- `personas/engineering.md` — full Engineering practice lead persona (non-stub).
- `personas/devops.md`, `personas/r-and-d.md`, `personas/data.md` — persona stubs.
- `tests/setup.bats` — 42-test bats suite covering read_config, check_prereqs, check_vault, symlink_claude_md, swap_role, rotate_backups, create_vault_dirs, print_summary, and main flow (~84% coverage).

### Changed
- `setup` — arg parsing now handles any flag order (`--role` and `--force` interchangeable); backup rotation capped at 5 files; trap reports line number on exit error.

### Security
- `setup:126` — added allowlist guard in `swap_role()` blocking path traversal via `--role '../FILENAME'` patterns; only `engineering|devops|r-and-d|data` are accepted (SEC-001).

## [0.0.1.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- `CLAUDE.md` — Toto Wolff persona with council, p10, and Karpathy execution discipline; `## ROLE` section is the sole swap point for persona changes.
- `setup` — installer script; creates vault dirs, symlinks `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` to repo; supports `TOTO_VAULT_PATH` env var; `--help` and `--force` flags; exit codes 2–5 documented.
- `runbook.md` — full install guide, first-run verification, SPOF notes, bus-factor checklist, and troubleshooting table.
- `docs/linear-setup.md` — Linear MCP integration permissions checklist and council→issue field mapping.
- `.claude/skills/strangler-pattern-guide/` — strangler pattern skill (express-web-api → actions.api migration); includes 4-line controller pattern, 6-phase TDD checklist, PRISM workflow YAML.
- `.gitignore` — excludes `.gstack/` and `settings.local.json`.

### Security
- Hardcoded dev credentials (`SuperAdmin/R3solv3!`) from MCP marketplace skill redacted to `<YOUR_USERNAME>/<YOUR_PASSWORD>` placeholders before first commit.
